The paper had yellowed with time, and the ink had faded, but every word was still there. 'Dear Sarah,' it began, 'I've been trying to find the right words to tell you how I feel...' Reading it now, five years later, I can't help but wonder what would have happened if I had been brave enough to give it to you. Would we have had those sunset walks we talked about? Would you have said yes when I asked you to stay? I guess I'll never know. But maybe that's okay. Maybe some letters are meant to remain undelivered, living forever in the space between what was and what could have been.",

'I can't do this anymore,' it said in your careful handwriting. No explanation, no fight, no chance to fix whatever had broken between us. Just silence and the echo of the door closing behind you. I sat there for hours, holding that note, trying to understand how three years could end with eight words. The worst part? I still don't know what 'this' was. Was it me? Was it us? Was it the life we'd built together? I've been replaying every conversation, every moment, looking for clues I missed. But maybe some endings don't come with explanations. Maybe sometimes people just... leave.",

Not a polite chuckle or a forced smile, but a real, belly-deep laugh that caught me completely off guard. It happened at the grocery store of all places. A little kid was throwing a tantrum over cereal, and his mom looked absolutely exhausted. 'At least someone knows what they want,' I said to her, and we both just started laughing. It was such a small moment, but it felt like everything. Like the first green shoot pushing through concrete after a long winter. I realized then that healing isn't about forgetting or 'getting over it.' It's about finding space for joy again, even when the sadness is still there. It's about remembering that you're more than your worst day, more than your biggest heartbreak.",

I almost didn't say anything - I'm not usually brave with strangers - but something about the way you smiled at the barista made me think you might be worth the risk. We talked for three hours about books and music and all the places we wanted to travel. You gave me your number on a napkin with a little doodle of a cat. I kept that napkin in my wallet for two years. We texted for weeks, made plans to meet again, but life kept getting in the way. You had exams, I had work, you were moving cities, I was... scared, probably. One day the texts just stopped. I never saw you again, but I still think about you every time it rains. I wonder if you ever think about the stranger who approached you in that coffee shop, or if I'm just a half-remembered face from a Thursday that meant everything to me and nothing to you.",
